This is a laborious and time consuming task. To allow FL automation search-based algorithms have been successfully applied in the field of Search-Based Fault Localisation (SBFL). However, there is no study mapping the SBFL field to the best of our knowledge and we believe that such a map is important to promote new advances in this field. Objective. To present the results of a mapping study on SBFL, by characterising the proposed methods, identifying sources of used information, adopted evaluation functions, applied algorithms and elements regarding reported experiments. Method. Our mapping followed a defined process and a search protocol. The conducted analysis considers different dimensions and categories related to the main characteristics of SBFL methods. Results. All methods are grounded on the coverage spectra category. Overall the methods search for solutions related to suspiciousness formulae to identify possible faulty code elements. Most studies use evolutionary algorithms, mainly Genetic Programming, by using a single-objective function. There is little investigation of real-and-multiple-fault scenarios, and the subjects are mostly written in C and Java. No consensus was observed on how to apply the evaluation metrics. Conclusions. Search-based fault localisation has seen a rise in interest in the past few years and the number of studies has been growing. We identified some research opportunities such as exploring new sources of fault data, exploring multi-objective algorithms, analysing benchmarks according to some classes of faults, as well as, the use of a unique definition for evaluation measures.

                                    | Fault localisation is an expensive and timeconsuming stage of software maintenance. Research is continuing to develop new techniques to automate the process of reducing the effort needed for fault localisation without losing quality. For instance, spectrum-based techniques use execution information from testing to formulate measures for ranking a list of suspicious code locations at which the program may be defective: the suspiciousness formulae mainly combine variables related to code coverage and test results (pass or fail). Moreover previous research has evaluated mutation analysis data (mutation spectra) instead of coverage traces, to yield promising results. This paper reports on a Genetic Programming (GP) solution for the fault localisation problem together with a set of experiments to evaluate the GP solution with respect to baselines and benchmarks. The innovative aspects are is the joint investigation of: (i) specialisation of suspiciousness formulae for certain contexts; (ii) the application of mutation spectra to GP-evolved formulae, i.e. signals other than program coverage; (iii) a comparison of the effectiveness of coverage spectra and mutation spectra in the context of evolutionary approaches; and (iv) an analysis of the mutation spectra quality. The results show the competitiveness of GP-evolved mutation spectra heuristics over coverage traces as well as over a number of baselines, and suggest that the quality of mutation-related variables increases the effectiveness of fault localisation heuristics.

                                    | Fault localisation is one of the most difficult and costly parts in software debugging. Researchers have tried to automate this process by formulating measures for assessment of code elements’ suspiciousness. This paper reports an evolutionary-based approach to combine non-linearly 34 previous measures to formulate a new program oriented fault localisation heuristic. The method was evaluated with 107 single-bug programs and compared against 35 approaches – 34 spectrum-based heuristics and a previous evolutionary linear combination approach. The experiments have shown that the proposal consistently achieved competitive results compared to the others according to several effectiveness metrics.

                                    | Spectrum-based fault localization techniques assess code elements suspiciousness with heuristics inspired by probabilistic and statistic models. This paper proposes a Genetic Programming (GP) approach to combine 18 existing spectrum-based fault localization heuristics into a project oriented faultlocalization formula. We evaluated the proposal with the 7 programs from the Siemens Suite with single-bugs and compared it against 19 approaches – 18 coverage-based heuristics and one combination approach. The results show that the proposal outperformed the others. Thus, we conclude the GP is a promising metaheuristic to formulate customized fault localization heuristics.

                                    | Context. In view of the high impact that the test activity has to the cost of software development and the great popularity of Functional Testing Techniques, it is observed that it is necessary to seek strategies that reduce the cost associated with testing without significant loss of quality. Purpose. To introduce an evolution of the method Functional Systematic Test (TFS), the Functional Test Systematic table-Decision (TFS-TD), and to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of both by using programs that are simple and available on LINUX distributions. Methodology. It is a quantitative, descriptive and case studies research, for the evaluation of TFS and TFS-TD methods and its comparison. Results. Guidelines and an iterative process for the application of TFS-TD were defined. Also, through the case studies, the effectiveness and efficiency of the method was quantified and confronted to the TFS method. Conclusions. The case studies revealed that the TFS-TD presents considerable savings in test cases with minimal loss in quality.

                                    | In 1986 Weyuker introduced a set of properties seeking to synthesize adequacy criteria’s abstract and intuitive features. In 1991 this set was redefined and had dependencies identified by Parrish and Zweben. This paper applies the properties sets to structural, functional and falt-based criteria, aiming the its evaluation and comparison. The results were the verification of the dependencies between the properties and the analysis of some criteria according with the properties. Finally, it was observed that the combined use of the two sets of properties gives greater abilities to the comparison between adequacy criteria.
