My responsibilities included the development and maintenance of systems built on an architecture based on RESTful Java and Kotlin back-end, as well as TypeScript and Angular front-end. I was also involved in the migration from an older version of the system, which was based on a Monolith JSF architecture, to a REST-based approach (Java/Kotlin back-end and Angular front-end). As the client is a multinational company, communication was predominantly conducted in English.

                                    | Context. Software is subject to the presence of faults, which impacts its quality as well as production and maintenance costs. Evolutionary fault localization uses data from the test activity (test spectra) as a source of information about defects, and its automation aims to obtain better accuracy and lower software repair cost. Motivation. Our analysis identified that the test spectra commonly used in research exhibit a high ratio of sample repetition, which impairs the training and evolution of Genetic Programming (GP) evolved heuristics. Problem. We investigate whether evolutionary training based on the uniqueness of suspiciousness scores can increase the ability to find software faults (defects), even in repeat-sample scenarios. Specifically, we examine whether the GP-evolved heuristic, which is based on the distinguishability of program elements in terms of faults, is really competitive. Methodology. The investigation formalized hypotheses, introduced three training strategies to guide the research and carried out an experimental evaluation, aiming to reach conclusions regarding the assessment of research questions and hypotheses. Analysis. The results have shown the competitiveness of all the proposed training strategies through evaluation metrics commonly used in the research field. Conclusion. Statistical analyses confirmed that the uniqueness of suspiciousness scores guides the generation of superior heuristics for fault localization.

                                    | Software testing and debugging are standard practices of software quality assurance since they enable the identification and correction of failures. Benchmarks have been used in that context as a group of programs to support the comparison of different techniques according to pre-established parameters. However, the reasons that inspire researchers to propose novel benchmarks are not fully understood. This article reports the investigation, identification, classification, and externalization of the state of the art about the proposition of benchmarks on software testing and debugging domains. The study was carried out using systematic mapping procedures according to the guidelines widely followed by software engineering literature. The search identified 1674 studies, from which, 25 were selected for analysis. A list of benchmarks is provided and descriptively mapped according to their characteristics, motivations, and scope of use for their creation. The lack of data to support the comparison between available and novel software testing and debugging techniques is the main motivation for the proposition of benchmarks. Advancements in the standardization and prescription of benchmark structure and composition are still required. Establishing such a standard could foster benchmark reuse, thereby saving time and effort in the engineering of benchmarks for software testing and debugging.

                                    | Context. Software Fault Localisation (FL) refers to finding faulty software elements related to failures produced as a result of test case execution. This is a laborious and time consuming task. To allow FL automation search-based algorithms have been successfully applied in the field of Search-Based Fault Localisation (SBFL). However, there is no study mapping the SBFL field to the best of our knowledge and we believe that such a map is important to promote new advances in this field. Objective. To present the results of a mapping study on SBFL, by characterising the proposed methods, identifying sources of used information, adopted evaluation functions, applied algorithms and elements regarding reported experiments. Method. Our mapping followed a defined process and a search protocol. The conducted analysis considers different dimensions and categories related to the main characteristics of SBFL methods. Results. All methods are grounded on the coverage spectra category. Overall the methods search for solutions related to suspiciousness formulae to identify possible faulty code elements. Most studies use evolutionary algorithms, mainly Genetic Programming, by using a single-objective function. There is little investigation of real-and-multiple-fault scenarios, and the subjects are mostly written in C and Java. No consensus was observed on how to apply the evaluation metrics. Conclusions. Search-based fault localisation has seen a rise in interest in the past few years and the number of studies has been growing. We identified some research opportunities such as exploring new sources of fault data, exploring multi-objective algorithms, analysing benchmarks according to some classes of faults, as well as, the use of a unique definition for evaluation measures.

                                    | Fault localisation is an expensive and timeconsuming stage of software maintenance. Research is continuing to develop new techniques to automate the process of reducing the effort needed for fault localisation without losing quality. For instance, spectrum-based techniques use execution information from testing to formulate measures for ranking a list of suspicious code locations at which the program may be defective: the suspiciousness formulae mainly combine variables related to code coverage and test results (pass or fail). Moreover previous research has evaluated mutation analysis data (mutation spectra) instead of coverage traces, to yield promising results. This paper reports on a Genetic Programming (GP) solution for the fault localisation problem together with a set of experiments to evaluate the GP solution with respect to baselines and benchmarks. The innovative aspects are is the joint investigation of: (i) specialisation of suspiciousness formulae for certain contexts; (ii) the application of mutation spectra to GP-evolved formulae, i.e. signals other than program coverage; (iii) a comparison of the effectiveness of coverage spectra and mutation spectra in the context of evolutionary approaches; and (iv) an analysis of the mutation spectra quality. The results show the competitiveness of GP-evolved mutation spectra heuristics over coverage traces as well as over a number of baselines, and suggest that the quality of mutation-related variables increases the effectiveness of fault localisation heuristics.

                                    | Fault localisation is one of the most difficult and costly parts in software debugging. Researchers have tried to automate this process by formulating measures for assessment of code elements’ suspiciousness. This paper reports an evolutionary-based approach to combine non-linearly 34 previous measures to formulate a new program oriented fault localisation heuristic. The method was evaluated with 107 single-bug programs and compared against 35 approaches – 34 spectrum-based heuristics and a previous evolutionary linear combination approach. The experiments have shown that the proposal consistently achieved competitive results compared to the others according to several effectiveness metrics.

                                    | Spectrum-based fault localization techniques assess code elements suspiciousness with heuristics inspired by probabilistic and statistic models. This paper proposes a Genetic Programming (GP) approach to combine 18 existing spectrum-based fault localization heuristics into a project oriented faultlocalization formula. We evaluated the proposal with the 7 programs from the Siemens Suite with single-bugs and compared it against 19 approaches – 18 coverage-based heuristics and one combination approach. The results show that the proposal outperformed the others. Thus, we conclude the GP is a promising metaheuristic to formulate customized fault localization heuristics.

                                    | Context. In view of the high impact that the test activity has to the cost of software development and the great popularity of Functional Testing Techniques, it is observed that it is necessary to seek strategies that reduce the cost associated with testing without significant loss of quality. Purpose. To introduce an evolution of the method Functional Systematic Test (TFS), the Functional Test Systematic table-Decision (TFS-TD), and to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of both by using programs that are simple and available on LINUX distributions. Methodology. It is a quantitative, descriptive and case studies research, for the evaluation of TFS and TFS-TD methods and its comparison. Results. Guidelines and an iterative process for the application of TFS-TD were defined. Also, through the case studies, the effectiveness and efficiency of the method was quantified and confronted to the TFS method. Conclusions. The case studies revealed that the TFS-TD presents considerable savings in test cases with minimal loss in quality.

                                    | In 1986 Weyuker introduced a set of properties seeking to synthesize adequacy criteria’s abstract and intuitive features. In 1991 this set was redefined and had dependencies identified by Parrish and Zweben. This paper applies the properties sets to structural, functional and falt-based criteria, aiming the its evaluation and comparison. The results were the verification of the dependencies between the properties and the analysis of some criteria according with the properties. Finally, it was observed that the combined use of the two sets of properties gives greater abilities to the comparison between adequacy criteria.
